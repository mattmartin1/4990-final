# 4990 Project
Vision Based Obstacle Detection Project

# Iteration 1
- Loading images into a GUI
- Finding and displaying SIFT points between loaded images
# Iteration 2
- Calculate homography
- Reworked GUI
- Added tools and help menus
# Iteration 3
- Added the 2nd method which uses trained models
# Iteration 4
- Added 50+ images to a bank used for testing the hallway
- Added the triangle crop to the homography calculation to focus on center of hallway
# Final Iteration
- Organized 3 different obstacle detection methods we completed
- Added the trained model demo back into main application
- Added console log box and a status box to the frame to provide user more feedback on what is going on
- Updated the crop method to properly detect an obstacle
